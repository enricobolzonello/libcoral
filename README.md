# LibCorAl: A Library of Coreset Algorithms

This library implements several algorithms, including:

- $k$-center clustering in several variants:
  - with outliers
  - with matroid constraints
  - with fairness constraints
- diversity maximization
  - with cardinality constraints
  - with matroid contraints
