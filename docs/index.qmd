This library collects several computational geometry algorithms based on the coreset technique.
Currently the focus is on clustering and diversity maximization, under a variety of constraints.

The problems this library deals with are NP-hard and often have rather
expensive approximation algorithms. To speed up the computation, the library
employs _coresets_. A coreset is a _concise summary_ of the data that retains
information about the overall structure: approximation algorithms (even
expensive ones!!) can be run on this small summary while still yielding
solutions that are valid with respect to the full dataset.
