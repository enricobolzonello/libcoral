This library collects several computational geometry algorithms based on the coreset technique.
Currently the focus is on clustering and diversity maximization, under a variety of constraints.

The problems this library deals with are NP-hard and often have rather
expensive approximation algorithms. To speed up the computation, the library
employs _coresets_. A coreset is a _concise summary_ of the data that retains
information about the overall structure: approximation algorithms (even
expensive ones!!) can be run on this small summary while still yielding
solutions that are valid with respect to the full dataset.

The package currently supports the following algorithms:

The software is implemented in Rust with a Python interface.
It can be [ used from R ](/using-with-r.html) as well.
